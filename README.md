Mission 2 for CS4404-B01

# Running the Server
Simply run "server.js" using Node and pass the webpage you would like to use as an argument. Because the server listens on port 80 (which is reserved for HTTP communications) you must run the program with `root` permissions.

e.g. `sudo nodejs server.js bombast.html`
